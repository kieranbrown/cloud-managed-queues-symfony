# laravel/cloud-symfony

Run [Laravel Cloud Managed Queues](https://laravel.com/cloud) from a Symfony
application, on top of [Symfony Messenger](https://symfony.com/doc/current/messenger.html).

Managed Queues are backed by SQS, but inside a Laravel Cloud container jobs are
**received from an in-container `cloud-agent` sidecar** over a unix socket rather
than polled from SQS directly. This package provides a Messenger transport that:

- **pushes** jobs straight to SQS, and
- **receives** them from the agent (`GET /next`), reporting each outcome back
  (`POST /result`) so the agent performs the actual SQS delete / visibility change.

When the agent socket is absent (e.g. local development) it transparently falls
back to receiving from SQS directly.

## Installation

This package is currently developed locally inside the host application via a
Composer `path` repository:

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        { "type": "path", "url": "packages/cloud-symfony", "options": { "symlink": true } }
    ],
    "require": { "laravel/cloud-symfony": "@dev" }
}
```

The bundle is auto-registered by Symfony Flex. If registering manually, add
`Laravel\Cloud\LaravelCloudBundle` to `config/bundles.php`.

## Configuration

Define a Messenger transport with the `laravel-cloud://` DSN and route your
messages to it:

```yaml
# config/packages/messenger.yaml
framework:
    messenger:
        transports:
            cloud: 'laravel-cloud://managed-queue'
        routing:
            'App\Message\ProcessJob': cloud
```

The SQS coordinates are read from the `LARAVEL_CLOUD_MANAGED_QUEUES_CONFIG`
environment variable injected by Laravel Cloud, so the DSN itself carries no
connection detail.

| Environment variable                   | Purpose                                            | Default                 |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `LARAVEL_CLOUD_MANAGED_QUEUES_CONFIG`  | JSON describing the SQS connection (prefix, suffix, queue, region, credentials) | — |
| `LARAVEL_CLOUD_AGENT_SOCKET`           | Path to the cloud-agent runtime socket             | `/tmp/cloud-agent.sock` |
| `LARAVEL_CLOUD_LOG_SOCKET`             | Address of the observability log socket            | `unix:///tmp/cloud-init.sock` |

Force the receive mode with the `use_agent` transport option if auto-detection
(socket presence) isn't desired:

```yaml
cloud: 'laravel-cloud://managed-queue?use_agent=true'
```

## Semantics

| Messenger    | Managed queue                                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `send()`     | SQS `SendMessage` (DelayStamp → `DelaySeconds`, capped at 900s)  |
| `ack()`      | agent `POST /result {status: processed}` → SQS delete            |
| `reject()`   | same as `ack()` — see below                                      |

Symfony implements retries by re-sending a fresh copy of the message and then
**rejecting** the original, so a rejected message must leave the queue — exactly
how Symfony's own SQS transport behaves. The agent's `released` outcome (reset
visibility for SQS-native redelivery) is therefore not used under Messenger's
re-send retry model.

## Observability

So Managed Queues surface the same metrics in the Laravel Cloud dashboard as a
Laravel app, the bundle emits the same observability events Laravel's framework
does — newline-delimited JSON written to the `LARAVEL_CLOUD_LOG_SOCKET` (the
wire protocol of `Illuminate\Foundation\Cloud\Events`). A Messenger event
subscriber maps the worker lifecycle onto those events:

| Cloud event              | When                                              | Mapped from                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `queue` / `queued`       | a message is dispatched onto the managed queue    | `SendMessageToTransportsEvent` |
| `queue` / `started`      | a worker receives a managed-queue message         | `WorkerMessageReceivedEvent`   |
| `queue` / `processed`    | handling succeeds (carries `duration_ms`)         | `WorkerMessageHandledEvent`    |
| `queue` / `released`     | handling fails but the message **will** retry     | `WorkerMessageFailedEvent`     |
| `queue` / `failed`       | handling fails terminally                         | `WorkerMessageFailedEvent`     |
| `failed_job`             | terminal failure — full payload + exception       | `WorkerMessageFailedEvent`     |

The failure handler runs after Messenger's retry listener so `released` vs.
`failed` reflects the final retry decision. Emission is best-effort: a socket
that is absent or unwritable (e.g. local development) is silently ignored and
never affects job processing.

## Testing

```bash
php bin/phpunit --testsuite "laravel/cloud-symfony"
```
